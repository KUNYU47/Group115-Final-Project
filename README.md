## Project Purpose

The Creative Weather Forecast Software delivers comprehensive weather forecasts, including current, hourly, and daily
updates. It also integrates a playful and personalized feature: virtual pets that appear under the weather checking
panel.
This project was designed to bridge functionality with fun. It was created to make checking the weather more enjoyable,
memorable, and unique.
It caters to users who value both practical information and a delightful, interactive experience. It provides users 
with accurate weather information, helping them to plan their days better.
