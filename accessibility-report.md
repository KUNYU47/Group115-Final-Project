## Principles of Universal Design

##### Equitable Use

The program's weather features and virtual pets are designed to appeal to users of all ages and technical skill levels.
Future plans include voice accessibility options so visually impaired users can interact with the software.

##### Flexibility in Use

Users can customize their experience by selecting pets and viewing either hourly or daily weather updates.
Adding flexibility for non-English speakers in the future.

##### Simple and Intuitive Use

The software has a user-friendly interface with clear labels for weather information and pet selection.
Future enhancements could include guided tutorials or tooltips to make navigation even simpler for new users.

##### Perceptible Information

Weather data is displayed with easy-to-read fonts, making it accessible for users with moderate visual impairments.
Adding audio descriptions for weather updates could better support users with severe visual impairments.

##### Tolerance for Error

Currently, the program has minimal error tolerance, but future updates could include warnings for invalid input
and undo functionality.

##### Low Physical Effort

The software is designed for minimal interaction: users can access all features with a few clicks.
Potential improvements include compatibility with voice-activated commands to reduce physical strain further.

##### Size and Space for Approach and Use

The current interface is optimized for desktop use but can be expanded for mobile compatibility, ensuring users can interact comfortably across all devices.

## Target Audience
The Creative Weather Companion is designed for people who value practical weather information presented in a fun and 
engaging way. This includes families, casual gamers who enjoy virtual pets, and professionals who want a lighthearted 
alternative to traditional weather apps. With customizable features and a visually engaging interface, it can also 
appeal to educators as a teaching tool.

## Potential Demographic Exclusion
The program may be less accessible to individuals with severe disabilities, since it currently lacks features 
like voice commands. Moreover, users without access to reliable internet or weather APIs may find it less useful,
as the program depends heavily on live data. To address these issues, future iterations should integrate more
accessibility features and consider offline functionality to support underserved demographics.
